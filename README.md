# Roblox_Game_Code
A Repository For my Roblox Scripts

#-- Going to Add Small Projects I create whilst learning to improve to eventually create a full game
- The Scripts in here will be used to help remember different technical parts to look back on as a reference or created as framework which can be reused
- Important Note that the code in these scripts were created using a mix of the Lua Documentation and Youtube Videos but also using AI to help debugging and for more of a general understanding of how to apply elements to a new game design
- Any Code will be in Lua
- This repository may also be used to remind of how different events need to be structured 
- Going to attempt to structure the scripts based on how they'd be in a game
