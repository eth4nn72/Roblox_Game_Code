# The basics of a leaderstats script
#-- Pretty much to be used in all games to track stuff to be displayed e.g. coins or distance travelled

# For this instance used in a tag game tracking the tags a player made and the times a player won

#----------------------------------------------------------------#
-- Game service
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local function playerSetup(player)
  -- Creates the leaderstat folder and assigns it to the player
	local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
	leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
	leaderstats.Parent = player

  -- Creating the values that are assigned in the folder 
	local tags = Instance.new("IntValue")
	tags.Name = "Tags"
	tags.Value = 0
	tags.Parent = leaderstats
	
	local wins = Instance.new("IntValue")
	wins.Name = "Wins"
	wins.Value = 0
	wins.Parent = leaderstats
end

-- Runs everytime a player is added
Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(playerSetup)
